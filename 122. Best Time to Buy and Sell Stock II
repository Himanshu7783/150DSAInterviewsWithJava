122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.
Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104
0 <= prices[i] <= 104

Solution : 

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return profit;
    }
}

This solution leverages the concept of "valley-peak" approach. It iterates through the price array and calculates the profit from each increasing subsequence (valley to peak).

Initialization:

A profit variable is initialized to 0 to store the total profit.
Iterating through Prices:

The loop starts from the second element (i = 1) and compares each price with its previous one.
If the current price is greater than the previous one, it means there's a potential profit to be made.
The difference between the current and previous prices is added to the profit variable.
Returning the Maximum Profit:

After processing all price pairs, the profit variable holds the maximum achievable profit.
The function returns this profit value.
Key Idea:

The key insight is that to maximize profit, we only need to consider the increasing trends in the price array.
By buying at the valley (lowest point) and selling at the peak (highest point) of each increasing subsequence, we can accumulate the maximum profit.
This approach is efficient and easy to understand, making it a suitable solution for this problem.
